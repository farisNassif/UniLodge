# UniLodge

Final Year Project - (TODO add a description of the project)


### Running the Program

¬Python runner.py
(If you're getting errors on the CLI, it's probably due to uninstalled requirements like Flask etc, run a `pip install [whatever the CLI is telling you you're missing`. You might need to do this a couple times.

*Open a second command Prompt
*cd into the client directory

¬npm start
