\chapter{Conclusion}
The main goal set out by the team from the beginning was to create a unique platform for students in the Galway area to both advertise and search for accommodation. Concluding the project, as a team we can say the goal has been achieved in the form of a web-application exclusively for students local to Galway. 

\paragraph{}
The proposed solution is intended to fill the market gap that was identified during the research phase. The finding showed there was no service for students to exclusively interact and advertise accommodate services. As a team we hope that by developing this service we can help bridge the gap between the two parties that previously had no access to a platform of this nature.
