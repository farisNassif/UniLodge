\chapter{Conclusion}
The main goal set out by the team from the beginning was to create a unique platform for students in the Galway area to both advertise and search for accommodation. Concluding the project, as a team we can say the goal has been achieved in the form of a web-application exclusively for students local to Galway. 

\paragraph{}
\textbf{UniLodge} is intended to fill the market gap that was identified during the research phase. The finding showed there was no service for students to exclusively interact and advertise accommodate services. As a team we hope that by developing this service we can help bridge the gap between the two parties that previously had no access to a platform of this nature.

\section{Key Insights \& Learning Outcomes}
Along the way, a wide range of learning outcomes and insights were gained, with most of them encountered indirectly and unexpectedly. This section will highlight and discuss the key insights acquired by the team.

\begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{\textbf{The Importance of Testing}}.
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{T}he team knew testing was an important part of building a robust system, however had to learn the hard way how vital it was in ensuring unexpected blockers and unexpected outcomes didn't outright halt and disrupt development.
  
  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{\textbf{Working with Diverse Technologies}}.
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{W}hile Angular, Flask, Python and MongoDB aren't exactly uncommon names to see in development stacks, working with specifically those names was found to be a rocky experience during the initial development phase. As it turned out, there wasn't a whole lot of content to be found integrating those three technologies.
  
  \paragraph{}
  To get a handle on how to assemble the stack meant reading through base level documentation to try and figure out where and how everything would fit together. Unfortunately, there was no cookie cutter method to get everything set up unlike there would be when working with a traditional MEAN stack. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  However the importance of effective research and documentation analysis was picked up, allowing the inclusion and wiring together of other components (\textit{albeit unintentional and unexpected}) and different methods of integrating them.

  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{\textbf{The Effect of Communication during Development}}.
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{T}he value of effective communication during the development of a project was understood. Unfortunately, internal communication issues did cause disruption during the project cycle. These would ultimately lead to loose ends, unfulfilled commitments and ambiguity surrounding major elements of the project. As a result, the scope of the project had to frequently be readjusted and redefined, leading to constant backlogs and ultimately features that wouldn't see implementation before the deadline.
