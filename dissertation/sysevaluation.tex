\chapter{System Evaluation}
The underlying goal of this project was to develop an easy to use web-application, providing both students searching for accommodation and those looking to share or advertise their rooms with a platform tailored exclusively for them. More precisely, the project objectives could be described as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Investigate the field by gathering the opinions and ideas of students in relation to the problem area.
  \item Based on information gathered and research on various state of the art technologies, develop an application that provides both students seeking accommodate services and those providing those services with an exclusive platform for which to connect.
  \item Build a full stack system that attempts to address the outlined problem domain while collaborating and communicating as a team throughout development.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation of Objectives}
This brief section will describe how each objective was addressed over the course of the project.

\begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{Investigate the field by gathering the opinions and ideas of students in relation to the problem area}. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{B}efore project development began, a survey aimed at students was distributed, allowing the team to gain valuable insight on necessary key features, similar applications and by extension set the foundation for which to commence development. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  During development, especially during the earlier stages, students were heavily involved in steering the course of development, providing key insights. For example, a feature that was intended to be implemented would allow users to 'follow' other users, following testing by students, it was determined that a commenting on system should be a much higher priority.
