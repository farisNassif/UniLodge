\chapter{System Evaluation}
The underlying goal of this project was to develop an easy to use web-application, providing both students searching for accommodation and those looking to share or advertise their rooms with a platform tailored exclusively for them. More precisely, the project goals could be summarized by the following objectives: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Investigate the field by gathering the opinions and ideas of students in relation to the problem area.
  
  \item Evaluate and research potential technological inclusions including frameworks, libraries and tools that may see a place within the development cycle.
    
  \item Based on information gathered and research on various state of the art technologies, Build a full stack system that attempts to address the outlined problem domain while collaborating and communicating as a team throughout development
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation of Objectives}
This brief section will describe how each objective was addressed over the course of the project.

\begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{Investigate the field by gathering the opinions and ideas of students in relation to the problem area}. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{B}efore project development began, a survey aimed at students was distributed, allowing the team to gain valuable insight on necessary key features, similar applications and by extension set the foundation for which to commence development. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  During development, especially during the earlier stages, students were heavily involved in steering the course of the project, providing key insights. For example, a feature that was intended to be implemented would allow users to 'follow' other users, following testing by students, it was determined that a commenting on system should be a much higher priority.

  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{Evaluate and research potential technological inclusions including frameworks, libraries and tools that may see a place within the development cycle}.
  
  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{R}esearch on a wide array of technologies was conducted which turned out to be highly beneficial  when it came to determining the best course to take with different components of the system. Research and prototyping helped eliminate frameworks and tools that the team felt had no place in the project or wouldn't be as effective in practice as they would be in theory.
  
  \paragraph{}
  As as example, if the project prototype was never developed and research was never conducted, the team may have ultimately considered VueJS as their frontend framework, initiating the development phase only to realise after time that the chosen technologies aren't as compatible with this specific framework as they would be with another. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  Instead, the team were able to take measures and identify the strengths and weaknesses of different technologies working together in unison and choose a stack that could both enhance the development skill of the team and yield a robust and user friendly application.
  
  \item[$\bullet$] \textit{Based on information gathered and research on various state of the art technologies, Build a full stack system that attempts to address the outlined problem domain while collaborating and communicating as a team throughout development}. 

  \paragraph{}
  \textbf{N}ot only does the developed platform allow users to exchange services and communicate with each other, achieving the end-goal of the project, but additional functionality was implemented based on previously gathered information and researched technologies, including login authentication, password security, user profiles and a gallery for images to name a few additional features.
  
  \paragraph{}
  While the application isn't perfect and has it's flaws, which the team are fully aware of, in terms of accomplishing a previously identified goal the application has absolutely accomplished it's objective. 
  
  \paragraph{}
  Unfortunately collaboration and communication between team members is something that cannot be said to be definitively maintained during development, this will be discussed further in the chapter along with system flaws and improvements.
