\section{Preliminary Research and Project Onset}
The first project meeting began in the final week of September, briefly after the project requirements had been assigned and outlined. An early start was agreed to be something that would greatly benefit the overall development of the project and it was concluded that an idea should be finalized as soon as possible to allow for necessary pre-development research.

\paragraph{}
This section will further explore the aforementioned pre-development process, the influence of the supervisory meetings on this stage, the overall methodical conclusion and it's influence on the initial project architecture.

\subsection{Initial Meeting and Brainstorming}
In the weeks before development began, after the project idea had been finalized, technologies, concepts and potential inclusions were explored and discussed between the team members. A brainstorming phase was conducted on what to incorporate into the project.

\subsubsection{Brainstorming}
The team members met prior to the initial supervisory meeting and discuss potential avenues of exploration during the development phase. To produce effective ideas, questions had to be asked relating to the ultimate goals and objectives of the project, these included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{\textbf{What research areas should be prioritized before the development phase is initialized?}}
    \item\textit{\textbf{What type of Methodology would best fit our approach?}}
    \item\textit{\textbf{What benefits would different methodologies have when compared to others?}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology Consideration}
There were numerous possible methodologies to consider, namely Waterfall, Rapid Application Development and Agile to name a few. Following discussions internally between the team members and talks with supervisors, the list of potential methodologies were shortlisted to both \textbf{Waterfall} and \textbf{Agile}.

\subsection{Determining the Methodology}
Following the decision to shortlist both Waterfall and Agile, research began on which route would be best to take when considering the scope and overall goals of the project and comparisons between the two were drawn. A brief high-level overview of both methodologies will be included followed by comparisons and a practical analysis of each methodology in relation to the project.

\subsubsection{Waterfall}
Like most traditional software development models and methodologies, the Waterfall model is based on a series of phases or steps which include \textbf{Defining Requirements}, \textbf{Architectural Design}, \textbf{Deployment and unit testing}, \textbf{Integration and system testing} and finally \textbf{Maintenance}. These steps are illustrated in \textit{Figure 2.1}.

The Waterfall model is arguably the most well known development model, which is likely attributed to how long the model has been around, not to mention it's overall simplicity. Waterfall being an easily understood model naturally means it isn't difficult to manage which is mainly attributed to it's strict requirement definitions, which ensures requirements are clearly defined, well received and understood \cite{WATERFALL}. Each phase is processed and undertaken uniformly, meaning phases are completed sequentially and don't overlap \cite{WATERFALL_REVIEW}.

\subsubsection{Agile}
Agile in relation to software development is a conceptual practice that allows software to be delivered to the end-user in periodical releases

\subsection{Github}

Github was used as the chosen method of version control for the project. A Git repository was setup remotely and used during development to allow for collaboration, code security and to track the progress of the project as well as providing the functionality of managing dependencies and providing alerts if new versions should arise.
