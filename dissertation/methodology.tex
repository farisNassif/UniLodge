\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Preliminary Research and Project Onset}
The first project meeting began in the final week of September, briefly after the project requirements had been assigned and outlined. An early start was agreed to be something that would greatly benefit the overall development of the project and it was concluded that an idea should be finalized as soon as possible to allow for necessary pre-development research.

\paragraph{}
This section will further explore the aforementioned pre-development process, the influence of the supervisory meetings on this stage, the overall research conclusion and it's influence on the initial project architecture.

\subsection{Initial Meeting and Brainstorming}
In the weeks before development began, after the project idea had been finalized, technologies, concepts and potential inclusions were explored and discussed between the team members. A brainstorming phase was conducted on what to incorporate into the project.

\subsubsection{Brainstorming}
The team members met prior to the initial supervisory meeting to share ideas and avenues to explore during the development phase. To produce effective ideas, questions had to be asked relating to the ultimate goals and objectives of the project, these included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{\textbf{To do?}}
    \item\textit{\textbf{This needs to be done?}}
    \item\textit{\textbf{Come back to this?}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Github}

Github was used as the chosen method of version control for the project. A Git repository was setup remotely and used during development to allow for collaboration, code security and to track the progress of the project as well as providing the functionality of managing dependencies and providing alerts if new versions should arise.
