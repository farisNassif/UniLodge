\chapter*{About this Project}
\paragraph{Abstract}
Housing, and the lack of affordable accommodation has become a hot topic in recent times, especially in relation to students having to endure undesirable living conditions for even more so undesirable rates. Daily, students are commuting great distances to avoid having to endure the financial burden of living at a local level. Students being unable to bear this burden leads to lower admission and attendance rates, an undesirable outcome for both the educational institutions and those looking to attend. 

\paragraph{}
The proposed solution will be a web application, providing an easily accessible platform for students, and for those living locally or living at a reasonable distance, who may not have the outlet to advertise their spare room or inhabited apartment. 
\paragraph{Authors}
This was developed as a 15 credit project by Faris Nassif and Aaron Burns, final year students of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

\paragraph{Acknowledgements}
The authors would like to acknowledge the project supervisors Dr.John French and Dr.Martin Kenirons for the time and advice they dispensed during the course of the project.
